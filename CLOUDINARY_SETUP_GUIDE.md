# 🌩️ Fix Image Corruption - Cloudinary Setup Guide

## 🚨 **Why Your Images Were Corrupting:**

Your Strapi backend is deployed on **Render.com**, which has **ephemeral storage**:
- ❌ Server restart → Images deleted
- ❌ Redeploy → Images deleted
- ❌ Server goes inactive (free tier) → Images deleted

**Solution:** Store images on **Cloudinary** (free cloud storage)!
